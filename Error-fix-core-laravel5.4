   For those running MariaDB or older versions of MySQL you may hit this error when trying to run migrations:

   [Illuminate\Database\QueryException]
   SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes (SQL: alter table users add unique users_email_unique(email))

   [PDOException]
   SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes
   As outlined in the Migrations guide to fix this all you have to do is edit your AppServiceProvider.php file and inside the boot method set a default string length:

   /app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php

   use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

   public function boot()
   {
       Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
   }
   After that everything should work as normal.
